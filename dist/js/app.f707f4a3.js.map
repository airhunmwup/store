Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\n                                        </li>\n                                        <li>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, and the AAA's International Centre for Dispute Resolution Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. Absent agreement of the parties, the AAA shall decide which AAA rules apply to the arbitration. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org and www.icdr.org. In the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the parties cannot reach the agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 18.C below) shall select the administrator.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link. The Notice to REJEE Stores must be sent to REJEE Stores Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W. REJEE Stores Way, Draper, UT 84020. REJEE Stores will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your REJEE Stores account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.\n</li>\n                                        <li>If you and REJEE Stores are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after REJEE Stores receives that Notice, you or REJEE Stores may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to REJEE Stores at the following address: REJEE Stores, Inc. c/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047. In the event REJEE Stores initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your REJEE Stores account. Any settlement offer made by you or REJEE Stores shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</li>\n                                        <li>If you are a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If you are not a resident of the United States, then the arbitration hearing will be held in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or REJEE Stores may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise. The language of the arbitration will be English.</li>\n                                        <li>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same REJEE Stores user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</li>\n                                        <li class=\"pb-3\"><b>3.\tCosts of Arbitration</b></li>\n                                        <li>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement (\"Arbitration Procedures\") and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, REJEE Stores will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by REJEE Stores should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and REJEE Stores will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse REJEE Stores for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by REJEE Stores on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</li>\n                                        <li class=\"pb-3\"><b>4.\tSeverability</b></li>\n                                        <li>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</li>\n                                        <li class=\"pb-3\"><b>5.\tOpt-Out Procedure</b></li>\n                                        <li><b>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (\"OPT-OUT\") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE (\"OPT-OUT NOTICE\").
