                                        <p class="p-3">Web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are small graphic images that are used in connection with the provision of our services and which typically work in conjunction with cookies to track the use of an online service by its users. For example, when we send you emails, web beacons allow us to track if you opened the emails and clicked links to measure campaign performance and improve features.</p>

This can be done by local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods, all of which store information in your browser or device. Additionally, there are other technologies that function without local storage in your end device and instead make use of, inter alia, browser functions. In this context, a "fingerprint" of your system is created that serves as a unique identifier.</p>
                                        <p class="p-3">These technologies may function across all your browsers and in some cases are not fully managed by your browser, but may need to be managed directly from your installed applications or your device. We sometimes use the terms cookies and similar technologies interchangeably.</p>

This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user's activities across multiple devices. Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyze your use of our Services. The data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information for users in the European Economic Area below in this section).</p>

This means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google's servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EU (or in another member state of the EEA), where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person.

The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google. The analyses by reCAPTCHA are carried out entirely in the background.</p>
