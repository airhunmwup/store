                                      If an item went missing and never arrived, you'll either need to provide additional tracking details from one of the shipping carriers integrated with REJEE Stores, or offer a replacement or refund. If the buyer got their item but it’s faulty, damaged, or doesn't match the listing description, you need to work with them to resolve their issue (you also have to cover the return shipping costs). If they changed their mind, how you can respond (and who pays for return shipping) depends on your return policy.

If you approve it and the buyer has already paid for the item, you have 10 business days to issue a refund. If you don’t refund the buyer within 10 days, they can file a claim through the REJEE Stores Money Back Guarantee.

                                        If the buyer wants to return an item to you, your options for responding depend on why they want to send it back. If the item is damaged, faulty, or doesn’t match the listing description, they’re covered by the REJEE Stores Money Back Guarantee, and you’ll have to refund them or replace the item, even if you don’t offer returns. If they’ve changed their mind, your options depend on your return policy.

                                        If you accept a return from the buyer, they need to send the item back to you before you issue a refund or send out a replacement. If the buyer is sending an item back because it doesn’t match the listing description or it arrived damaged or faulty, you’re responsible for the cost of return shipping, even if you don’t offer returns. If they simply changed their mind or ordered the wrong item, who pays for return shipping is determined by your return policy.

We’ll assess all the information and come to a decision. It’s important to remember that if you ask us to step in and we close the case in the buyer’s favor, you could receive a defect (which might affect your seller standards), so you should only ask us for help when you’ve exhausted all other options.

In order to request an appeal, you must provide additional details for us to take into consideration, such as photographs showing there’s nothing wrong with the item. We’ll review your new information and get back to you with our final decision, usually within 48 hours.
