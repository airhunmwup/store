                                      If your item hasn’t arrived, you can let the seller know and they’ll have to either send a replacement or give you your money back. If your item has arrived, but there’s something wrong with it, or it doesn’t match the listing description, you can return it. Most sellers are also willing to accept returns if you’ve just changed your mind.

They’ve got 3 business days to make things right for you, and you can always keep track of what’s going on.</li>

If your item has gone missing, or if it’s damaged or faulty, most sellers are happy to work with you to resolve the issue. Either way, you’re covered by the REJEE Money Back Guarantee.

If the estimated delivery date has passed, let the seller know so they can help you out. They’ll either provide you with additional delivery information, send you a replacement, or offer you a refund.

                                        If you bought an item on REJEE as a guest, you’re still covered if something goes wrong. Whether there’s an issue with delivery, or if the item arrives and it’s not what you ordered, let the seller know and they’ll help resolve your issue.

                                        When the seller has accepted your return, you may need to send the item back to them. Who pays the shipping costs depends on the reason you’re returning it. If the item was damaged or faulty, they’re responsible for the return shipping costs – if you changed your mind, who covers the cost will depend on the seller’s return policy.

In order to request an appeal, you’ll have to provide additional details for us to take into consideration, such as photographs showing what’s wrong with the item. We’ll review the new information, and get back to you with our final decision, which usually takes 48 hours.
