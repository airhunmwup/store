                                      After you’ve made a sale on  Stores, it’s usually a smooth process to complete the transaction with the buyer, but sometimes you might find yourself in a situation where the buyer hasn’t yet paid for the item they bought. If that happens, you can cancel the order 4 calendar days after the listing ended and your item will be relisted automatically unless you choose not to relist.
                                    </p>

                                      Sellers don't need to open unpaid item cases any longer. Instead, orders can be canceled if a buyer hasn't paid within 4 calendar days. If you still have open unpaid item cases, you have 36 days from the date they were opened to close them. If you don't close them within 36 days, we'll close them for you, but you won't be eligible for a final value fee credit and the unpaid item won't be recorded on the buyer's account.
                                    </p>

                                      You can automate how you manage unpaid items by enabling Preferences for items awaiting payment on your account.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-dark p-2">
                                       If you only sell occasionally or you haven't yet set up your Preferences for items awaiting payment, you can send the buyer an invoice to remind them to pay. Here's how:
                                    </p>
                                <div
                                  class="container text-left p-3 border-warning border"
                                >
                                  <div class="content text-dark">

                                    <p>
You don't have to contact the buyer if they haven't paid – we'll send them reminders to pay. If they don't pay after 4 calendar days, you can cancel the order.
                                    </p>
                                  </div>

                                      When you enable Preferences for items awaiting payment, you can customize your settings so that orders that aren't paid for will be canceled automatically after 4 calendar days. You can also customize your settings to relist unpaid items straight away. Additionally, any feedback left by the buyer of an unpaid item will be removed. As well as saving you time, enabling Preferences for items awaiting payment also ensures that you receive credit for any applicable fees if a buyer doesn't pay.
                                    </p>

                                      You can only use Preferences for items awaiting payment when you use REJEE Stores Stores checkout, which means that the buyer pays through the standard checkout flow, not cash on delivery or with a check.
                                    </p>

                                      If you accept cash on local pickup, checks, or money orders on your listings, you'll need to remove these payment methods if you want to use Preferences for items awaiting payment on those listings.
                                    </p>

                                      While Preferences for items awaiting payment is available on most REJEE Stores Stores listings, including items listed in REJEE Stores  Motors, Parts & Accessories, it can't be used for vehicle listings in REJEE Stores Motors. If you've sold a car and haven't received payment, you can manually cancel an order in Seller Hub or My REJEE Stores Sold.
