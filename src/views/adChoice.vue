You have the ability to opt out of these customized ads at any time. Please keep in mind if you opt out, you'll still see ads, but they won't be tailored to your interests based on your eBay activity.</p>

                                <p class="font-weight-bold text-dark">We may work with other companies, like websites or ad networks to show customized ads to you. These partners may have access to your information in order to assist us with providing you customized ads. Advertisers and other third parties (e.g., advertising platforms and service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with a targeted ad are part of the group that the ad is directed toward. Also, some third parties may provide us information about you (e.g., demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant advertising. Read more about our policies on sharing information with other companies in our Privacy Notice.</p>

                                <p class="font-weight-bold text-dark">But you can tell us not to use your eBay activity to customize advertising we show you, whether on eBay or anywhere else on the web. Whenever you see the "About" or "Adchoice" link next to or in one of the ads we serve, or in the footer of one of our websites, click it to check and change your advertising preferences. Also, we support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and have integrated our opt-out platform with the DAA choice tool available here. Remember, when you opt out, you'll still see ads, but they won't be tailored to your interests based on your eBay activity.</p>
