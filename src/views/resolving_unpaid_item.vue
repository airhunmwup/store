                                      After you’ve made a sale on REJEE, it’s usually a smooth process to complete the transaction with the buyer, but sometimes you might find yourself in a situation where the buyer hasn’t yet paid for the item they bought. If that happens, you can cancel the order 4 calendar days after the listing ended and your item will be relisted automatically unless you choose not to relist.
                                    </p>

                                      Sellers don't need to open unpaid item cases any longer. Instead, orders can be canceled if a buyer hasn't paid within 4 calendar days. If you still have open unpaid item cases, you have 36 days from the date they were opened to close them. If you don't close them within 36 days, we'll close them for you, but you won't be eligible for a final value fee credit and the unpaid item won't be recorded on the buyer's account.
                                    </p>

                                      You can automate how you manage unpaid items by enabling Preferences for items awaiting payment on your account.
                                    </p>

                                      If you only sell occasionally or you haven't yet set up your Preferences for items awaiting payment, you can send the buyer an invoice to remind them to pay. Here's how:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="p-2">
                                      If the buyer still hasn't paid after you've sent the invoice, and it's been more than 4 calendar days since the listing ended, cancel the order by selecting the Cancel order button below and choosing Buyer hasn't paid in the drop down menu.
                                    </p>

                                      Once you cancel the order, you'll receive a credit for any applicable fees, and your item will be relisted automatically unless you choose not to relist. We'll also remove any feedback left by the buyer.

                                      Once the order has been canceled, you can make a second chance offer to the next highest bidder if you listed using the auction format.

                                      It's important to cancel any unpaid items within 30 days from the day the buyer commits to buy so the item can be relisted unless you choose not to, and you receive credit for any applicable fees.

                                      When you enable Preferences for items awaiting payment, you can customize your settings so that orders that aren't paid for will be canceled automatically after 4 calendar days. You can also customize your settings to relist unpaid items straight away. Additionally, any feedback left by the buyer of an unpaid item will be removed. As well as saving you time, enabling Preferences for items awaiting payment also ensures that you receive credit for any applicable fees if a buyer doesn't pay.

                                      You can only use Preferences for items awaiting payment when you use REJEE checkout, which means that the buyer pays through the standard checkout flow, not cash on delivery or with a check.

                                      While Preferences for items awaiting payment is available on most REJEE listings, including items listed in REJEE Motors, Parts & Accessories, it can't be used for vehicle listings in REJEE Motors. If you've sold a car and haven't received payment, you can manually cancel an order in Seller Hub or My REJEE Sold.
